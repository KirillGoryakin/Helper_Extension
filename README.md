This is a simple extension for Google Chrome browser that can give you hints of what you selected. It automatically detects if it's an equation, a price or it's just a text in a foreign language.

## ðŸ’¡ It has 3 main features:
- Calculation
- Currency conversion
- Text translation 

Currency rates update once a day and save to cache. Text translations also save to cache up to 300 strings. Caching saves you a lot of requests to the API and boosts result speed. Translation cache can be easily cleared if needed.

# <img src="docs/icons/api.png" width="45" align="left"> How to enable text translation?
This extension uses [**Translo API**](https://rapidapi.com/armangokka/api/translo) for text translation. This API requires an **API key** to work. Don't worry! **It's free** and easy to get! You just need a few actions.

## How to get an **API key**?
1. To obtain one firstly, you need to sign up or log in [**RapidAPI**](https://rapidapi.com/) site.
2. After you sign up go to [Translo API pricing page](https://rapidapi.com/armangokka/api/translo/pricing) and subscribe to **Basic**, free plan.<br/><img src="docs/screenshots/s1.png" width="640">
3. Then go to [Endpoints page](https://rapidapi.com/armangokka/api/translo) and copy your API key from *Code Snippets* block. Your key should be labeled as "*X-RapidAPI-Key*". Be aware! **Don't copy the quotation marks!**<br/><img src="docs/screenshots/s2.png">
4. Then go to the extension option menu and paste your key to the "*API key*" field<br/><img src="docs/screenshots/s3.png">

Congrats! You did it! Now you can enable text translation and enjoy! But remember that your translations are limited. 500k characters per month is more than enough, but make sure you don't waste it.
